"While it is often argued by some people that youngsters are more responsible in the current era, whereas  others take the view that  many young people are more attentive in the old days. My opinion is that it is better to hold much responsibility  nowadays.

On  one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that children grow with less responsibility. The major reason for believing this is that laziness. This is due to  they spend more time with social media such as  Facebook, Twitter and  Tumbler. Furthermore, it urges them to check their cell phone  frequently and  this leads to lack of helping others. Another reason is that children's are really careless when they do daily activities For example, a child aged between 8 to 12 years are less attentive in their work.  

Despite the above arguments, I hold the position that young people are more responsible.   Indeed, one reason why I take this position is that they are focused in the field of education. Since  the education system in the  modern era is  highly competitive  and they were facing many difficulties to study. However, it is my opinion that kids show respect to their elders in the family. To illustrate, the New York Times  publishes an article about the responsibilities of children at a young age which surge  from the year 2019 to 2020.As a result, the bonding between both are very strong and brings more happiness in the family.

In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that youngsters show more responsibility. This is because education is most important  and in addition to family bonding. Given this situation, it is recommended that the government around the world should think about implementing this form of encouragement through  online media.",9.0,6.0,6.0
"In recent years, the concept of the phenomenon has become widespread, referring to people who have become famous for their lifestyle. Sometimes the youth try to pretend to be like them. To my mind, it may have several negative consequences.

It is a simple supply-demand pattern, in which they try to provide the audience with something more required. Unfortunately, youngsters prefer glamorous celebrities instead of talented ones. Those who come to the agenda with their scandalous and rich lives are in the spotlight. For example, the Kardashian family has not any specific achievements; however, for a showy lifestyle, they have a huge following. They make unnecessary expenses and take part in meaningless events. This could be a bad example for teenagers who take them as role models. When the life they want is not offered, they can become depressed and, worse, rebel against their families or can behave inappropriately. 

In fact, some celebrities are often found in smoking advertisements, charged with drugs and other criminal activities. A young person who chooses this kind of famous person as an idol will be able to damage their health. Another example can be the impact of a particular celebrity's bad roles in films or series. For instance, Sanjay Dutt, Bollywood Actor is well known for his money and roles as a villain, his terrorist acts in different movies have given rise to violence and crime in the streets of Mumbai, all these were committed by adolescents for thrill and adventure.

In brief, because of the information age, children and adolescents are informed by watching TV, using social networks, and can follow celebrities on these platforms as their role models. If the younger generation is not properly guided, such things can have bad effects on them.",7.5,6.5,6.5
"Government spend money on various amenities and facilities for the people of their country.However, there is always an ongoing debate on how government should spend their money. Some people believe that money should spend money on arts and others believe to spend money on health facilities and on betterment of education system.

Spending money on the arts would bring various economic benefits to the country. By using money to renovate old art and develop new will attract more tourists to visit the country and help our economy to grow. With the profit gained from tourism we can use that for the overall development of the country.For instance, One of the most profitable sectors in todays world is tourism and by developing arts we can boost the economy of our country which would help in the progress of our nation.

However, spending money on health and education would improve the quality of life. By spending money on the welfare of the society the life of the citizens improves gradually.Providing better health facilities to help people to survive for a longer period of time.Improving education facilities will help the youth to study efficiently and would eventually help them to become successful in the future. The government increases the quality of life by giving citizens the basic rights.For instance, in a survey, it is proved that improving quality of education students can improve themselves by 15%.

In my opinion, providing better health facilities and improving education should the  priority of the government as giving them basic amenities would improve the quality of life and would increase the expectancy of life.",5.0,6.0,6.0
"There is no boubt that these days the climate is chnging a lot, beacuse  the human and government makes many action impact on the weather. The question is, can we find a way to live with this argument?. In this essay i am going to explain my view and draw my personal conclusion.

In tearms of some reasons which makes climate chang. Firstly, is a global warmaing. The globel waming become beacuse man's activities. When the human bulding the factory in area has many trees and population , the smok from the factory  hurts the atmosphere. Also, if the countris have traffic crowded, the soke from car also impacts on the climate. secondly, the carbon dioxed produced  by gases or fossil fuels , it is the maen reason to increased the globel warming and temperature degrees. So, the individual should be cooprate on reduce of carbon rate by limiting the use of their vehicles and consming energy in factores.

More over, the globel warming will be dangerous in future. To illustrate, the increaseing on temperatue hurts plants and makes the ice is melting. That is mean, the level sea is rising in neare future and the is didn't a good news to our lives, beacuse the most cities are close to sea and oction. So, when level sea incrasing, many flooding will happen.

In conclsion, in my opinion, we should keeping oue environment by prevent the resaons which hurts it , so i don't agree with this argumant that we should find a way to live with it . We should did some thing to solving this issue.",4.5,5.0,5.0
"It is undeniable that many accommodations such as houses in some countries were built for a long time. As the result, many persons are becoming interested the history of the house or building they live in, and they want to find out about their residential. From my point of view, I think that they have many reasons that made them interested in the house history, and they also have many methods to find out. In the following paragraph, the reasons to support my opinion will be outlined in the detail. 

It is true to say that one of the major reasons of finding out about the history of their accommodation is that people are often afraid the house they live in had been robbed or someone had died. Additionally, people consider safety of the accommodations they stay in because if the building were built for a long time, they should maintain it before they move in. For example, many persons in Thailand modern society are often searching some information about the building before they make the decision to buy or rent due to they consider the problems which will come later. 

In addition, people have the different methods to find out about the structure history. For instance, Internet service has used the maximum to search some information about their building due to it is easily to access with everyone, and asking some neighbours who stay for a long time before they move in is also a good way. 

In conclusion, fear and safety are the factors that lead people to start researching the history of their homes. Therefore, it is recommended that finding out about the history of the house is an important thing that everybody should do before the decision to move in.",5.5,6.0,6.0
"Some cultures have a belief that younger family members should be responsible for elders in the family by law once they no longer have enough strength to look after themselves in both physically and mentally ways. This has become a controversial issue. From my point of view, I am disagreed with this idea and reckon it should not be made legal. The reasons for my argument will be explained further in the following paragraphs before the conclusion is reached.

At present, there are some segments of society who think that it is a necessary job for descendants to take care of the elderly when they become physically and mentally weak. However, I strongly disagree with this, not with the fact that pupils take care of elders but with the belief that it should be made legal. I always think that it is a good deed for youth to look after their family members, but this should be an optional choice. Everyone has their own right to choose whether they want or do not want to do something. 

Furthermore, it is found by one of the surveys that some people, including young ages, are not ready to hold others' lives in their hands because they are still struggling with their own lives. For instance, think about a person who works all day and night but is still surrounded by problems such as financial, working, and educational issues. Therefore, it would be best for these people to look after their family members when they are ready or it would give them more burden.

In conclusion, even though some populations believe that the younger members of the family should be legally responsible for the elderly, I disagree with this and think that everyone must have the right to choose. Hence, it should not be made as a legal law but should be an optional choice. The offspring must look after others when they think they are ready and do not have any other burden.",7.0,6.0,6.0
"individuals believe that the great method to achieve successful is academic institutions, while others believe that we have good at to skill and having natural talent which can help to gain progression. This essay will be discuses both of aspect with my perspective.

There is a lot of arguments that why people want to finish their tertiary school. Firstly, a number of people would like to become a doctor, engineer and other fields.

If a member of society to complete their listen then they don’t have any problem to get a job For instance amazon, people which are interesting in a getting job than they will have to show their degree.

"It is argued that it is possible to resolve a part of environmental problems if the cost of fuel for the personal and commercial transport will significantly increase. I particularly agree with this statement and in this essay, I will try to explain why. 

On the one hand, burnable fuel it is the main resource of energy in modern world, and the cost of the fuel has a great impact for the cost of food and goods, hence people try to save their money what extend to conscious consumption of the fuel and more effective logistic ways. Therefore, the fuel economy is decreased amount of the pollution to the environment which has a positive influence on the nature. Moreover, cost of fuel extends to developing of advanced technology and it is a fact that modern cars have a less exhaust of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than earlier. For example, Scandinavian countries stimulate people to keep the fuel economy policy and to have modern vehicles by way to cancellation of taxes to the owners of cars with zero emissions. 

On the other hand, increasing the cost of the fuel in poor countries, could stimulate people to use mo cheaper and dirtier fuel, which only increases air pollution.",3.5,5.5,5.5
"In the modern world, many people have increasingly paid attention about their house or building, and they also make an effort to find a large amount of information about the house and building. In this essay, I discuss about the reasons why people are eager to find out about the history of their building or house, and suggest the way to reach materials about them. 

I believe that there are two remarkable reasons why people want to research about the house or building. The most important one is that theses days, a number of people consider their own houses or  buildings  as real estate property. To be specific, they transact their apartments and mansiosn by making a sale or purchase them, which means that they believe that their houses could be effective means of investment, and they also have to know a huge deal of information about their products. Meanwhile, other people are likely to realize historical value of their buildings where they have constantly lived in. For example, if their buildings or houses are quite old, they would get intersted in gaining plenty of stories which the buildings or houses contain, which means that they would be keen to find structures and materials of the building, and a design paradigm related to the historical possessions. 

People who want to know about their own house could utilize many ways to get useful information. The most simple strategy is that just questioning to elder family members, and the neighborhood living nearby for a long time could play a critical role in providing conclusive information. In addition, it is also pretty efficient way for the people to search copy of a house deed, which is a document specifies the detail of a certain house. If people could prove that they have ownership of thier house or building, they would get the material in public offical or on the Internet.

"In today's modern world, money and appearance are one of the main things to be popular while achievements become less 

important. Moreover, this trend might be an awful instance for a new generation. I agree with this statement due to the fact that a huge salary becomes the main aim for students which is a bad habit. This essay will elaborate on the reasons why this motion is terrible. 

The achievements become lessness for plenty of people which has a poor effect on education and science. The main reason

 this community does not pay attention to how much power and energy celebrities spend to achieve their wealth. Furthermore, a huge part of stars does not tell about their hard way which provides students the idea that social status is easy to reach. As the result, many students become lazier and drop their education which as result makes the progress of technology

slower.

 

Besides, appearance and wealth start to be the main purpose of youth which makes them more selfish and unhappy. On top of that, the cause of that is money allows people to purchase everything that makes life more comfortable and easier. Also,with glamour, they guess that everyone would love them and their life would be happier. However, many of them become more lonely due to their traits which were gained by competition for money and popularity.

In conclusion, this trend has an awful impact on young people such as producing students with terrible habits and traits.

 In addition, that movement demonstrates a bad influence on education and technology since the students suppose that achieve high social status is lightweight and as the result, they do not spend much time on education.",6.0,5.5,5.5
"In the recent era, the increasing number of vehicles on road is becoming a serious issue. There are multiple reasons behind the uplifting number of wheelers on road.In my coming paragraphs ,I shall shed light on the causes and solutions of traffic congestion.
On the reasons side,the people offenly use their private vehicle for job purpose.The masses hardly use public transport to mobile from one place to another .To illustrate, In big cities the working hours of people are depend upon the need of the companies .So,the human being want to use their own wheelers to go for job .The human beings do not have patience and time to wait for the public transport.Apart from this,
Due to the impact of global village ,the people are much more interested in traveling.The travellers want to use their convienient means of transport to go at various places.
On turning to the measures side,the higher authorities should encourage the masses to use public transport.The government should provide various concession on government means of transport ,so that,it can shift the mind compass of people toward the increase demand of public transport .For example,the higher administration should bless the people with quick and comfortable buses service .With the help of this higher rank service ,the people will choose public transport unquestionably.Moreover,the human body should also believe in sharing the private means of transport .There are multiple ways with which mankind can share their personal wheelers .
In conclusion,the increasing number of vehicles on road is critical problem .It has many reasons and we all should come one step forward to tackle this issue.",4.5,5.5,5.5
"It is assumed that occupations will be overtaken by robots in the near future. However, I think that, to some extent, menial jobs will be done by the intelligence machines but human intervention would still be necessary for certain jobs. This essay will discuss and differentiate the types of work that can be done by robots or not.

To begin with, Robots will replace all human workplaces which require less effort. Many companies will switch to a robotic workforce because it will be far less expensive than hiring and training a human. In Dubai, for example, numerous shops have automated cashier systems. In addition, these automated billing systems run 24/7 and does not require holidays or holiday pay. For these reasons, unskilled jobs will definitely be substituted by automatic computers in the future.

Conversely, there are certain sectors of work that can never be handled by artificial technology. Sectors such as psychology, education, medicine and social work will always require ‘human touch’. For instance, a robot can never be used in a school or a college for teaching because teachers have to explain in different ways depending on the student’s understanding. This is why certain fields of work will never be computerized or automated.

In conclusion, it is a higher possibility that a significant number of jobs will be conducted by artificial intelligence in the future. While, simple tasks will completely be done by robots, human brilliance and attention would still be necessary for a sophisticated field. Ultimately, only a few jobs will be left for humans in an increasingly transforming technology of artificial intelligence.",8.5,7.0,7.0
"It is argued that the lack of accommodations in metropolitans can result in serious impacts and in order to tackle those problems, government action is the only choice. In my opinion, I totally agree with the statement for the following reasons. 

To start with, many people suppose that individuals can offer aid by creating and setting up their own houses which are fully attached with amenities. However, I believe this is a short-sighted view. To make this clear, a person can afford the money to purchase or even construct a shelter to live in but they can not guarantee the quality of the materials for the structures. For instance, in 2019, a family consisting of 5 members in a small village of Hokkaido - Japan managed to create a house made of bricks and woods on their own. Even though it was well-designed with plenty of decorations and furniture, eventually the house collapsed and took away the lives of the whole family. Due to their deaths, the police found out that the system of their house was not strong enough to handle and resulting in a tragedy. Thus, there is a high risky chance to deal with this problem alone.

On the other hand, I strongly believe that the solutions to this issue could be undertaken by the government. The authorities always prior the safety of citizens first so they often provide the basic facilities for them. To address this, many high-rise blocks, skyscrapers,...etc which solve people’s housing have been completed. One of the best examples of this would be in the USA, the government has witnessed the booming population and responded to the inhabitants by devising plans to make buildings that could house people. Additionally, those buildings can ease the traffic for the commuters and facilitate the community’s lives but also the most important thing is that still remains the quality of the structures. Besides, by resolving all the housing issues, more and more people will definitely move in from the urban areas to seek opportunities. ",8.5,6.5,6.5
"Our society is attracted by the past, because is often unknown. We spend a huge amount of time  studying the past, at school, with books, films and documentaries. Nowadays, more and more individuals are searching for information about the history of the accommodation or building where they live. The reasons behind this can be very interesting and are also available many tools in order to discover it. 

The human being is naturally curious about his roots. So, we cannot be surprised if a lot of people are looking for interesting information about their house. This is due to two main reasons.

Firstly, the individuals hope that they can find something very strange about their building, because they want to talk with friends about something new and interesting about themselves and their life.

Maybe they can discover that the ancient owner of the property was a rich man, an artist, or even more a famous writer. For instance, in England, last year a man discovered that one of his ancestors left a chest full of gold doubloons behind the wall of the living room, and after some surveys he found it and he became very rich.

Secondly, they want to know something more about the place, such as the conditions of the building or any problems, so, by knowing the history of their home, is possible for them to study some critical things that can happen in the future and prevent them. For instance, they can notice that in the past the structure has had some problems with the soil in the foundations and call an architect to fix it.

For everyone who is interested in the past of the accommodation where he lives in, it's possible to find information about it at the local library and in the urban offices of the city. In this kind of place, the documents about properties are preserved in specific archives. They also have an official website on the Internet where it's possible to find every document, without joining the place.

"Many claimes that the most effective way to become successful in careers is studying at university or college. However ,some people opine that by merely finishing courses at school we can get work.From my point of ,view, I believe learning subjects at university is the best route to find a suitable occupation and become successful.

Firstly ,in my ,opinion, the most significant method to find an appropriate opportunity for getting a high_poweful job is studying in an educational centre. For example ,there are multiple workshops besides courses in order to face different challenges at the workplace. Also ,these could help to solve the problems related to a particular job. This would create  enough knowledge as well as obtain experience in an educational environment. Therefore ,this makes it clear why learning fields at colleges or universities is one of the most important means to become a skilful workforce.

By contrast ,some  people  believe that learning diverse themes in school is adequate to get a job. To  give a clear example ,in most countries around the world there are numerous works that do not need to study higher education at universities such as carpentry , fishing and mechanical works. These people believe theory education is not  a necessary instrument to become thriving in careers but deriving practical experiences is the most essential thing. This would create a noticeable speed to clime the career lather in works without wasting time besides money to conduct a training course in educational centres. As a result ,it becomes apparent this is not required to learn these subjects in a class or workshop. Especially occupations that need to attain experience.

To summarise ,I completely believe that learning at university could cause being flourishing ,however, we can not ignore the importance of obtaining practical knowledge. It is predicted that  by studying and training different courses  the human knowledge will continue to rise to prepare for becoming",8.5,6.0,6.0
"Few people believe that the amount of time children invest in playing electronic games is valuable,while some peoples trust that it really has a bad impact on a child too.In my opinion the children are wasting their precious time if they are getting used to it on a regular basis and it also leaves a bad impact on their well being as well.


In the present world the children spend most of their free time in front of computers mobiles and electronic gadgets rather than going out there under the sun to get involved in physical activites and sports which helps them being fit  in a longer run. The only stress buster after hours of lectures they would have had since morning is the free time they get in the evenings which they despite choose to spend being all alone in front of these gadgets rather one has to go out there and get social with the children of their age so that they can involve in some of the things which keep them fit.


The impact which these leaves on children in future might be far more intense.One gets deprived of the social network and get used to being all alone which does not serve good in the long run. Infact investing long hours in front of them can lead to a child having problems with his eye which is really not appreciated.


Although there are some feeble chances that a child can attain great heights if he/she chooses to make a living out of it by becoming a proffessional gamer it has lead to more negative impact rather than positive ones. Overall if a child is deprived from getting used to those new technologies he/she will have an amazing future a in terms of health if not being actually successful in life but who knows the same amount of time they may invest in developing their career perspectives and achieve a great feet.",4.0,5.0,5.0
"It is believed that money ought to be disbursed on forming new public settings, for instance, museums and town halls as distinct from the renovation process of the current buildings. In my opinion, the public finance should be allocated to both the renovation and the creation of cultural areas as they are valuable assets of a city independently of the mode of existence. 

Governments should pay attention to conserve historical museums, regional areas or other buildings, as they are vital for a country to attract tourists. Some of them are successfully doing it through restorative methods. Conversely, others who do not have any remnants of historical places are obliged to create new ones. Take for instance, the United Arab Emirates are constructing hundreds of buildings every year to develop its nation culturally, and thus it is one of the most visited country in its region. 

European countries have many renovated museums and halls, and this gives a feeling as you were in a time tunnel. However, newly constructed buildings are also successful at transmitting the ancient texture of that city to visitors. In terms of costs, the renovation can be by far more expensive than the construction of a new one, yet rich countries will overcome this problem easily. 

In conclusion, public settings play an important role in the cultural development of the nation, and thus they are highly preferred tourist attractions. I believe that, money should be spent on both of them. Rich countries may allot more funds for the restoration, while poor ones have to focus on building these with spending the least amount as possible.",7.0,7.0,7.0
"It is believed by some people that driving vehicles are the first choice when they go out. Others, on the contrary, think that riding bicycles are prioritised. This essay will introduce reasons of the trend and give my opinions.
Travelling by bikes have two advantages.Firstly,it is good for our health. The bicycle is an environment-friendly transportation as it never needs fuel, which causes no pollutants in the air. As the result, the risk of several diseases may be decreased. Secondly, Riding bicycles will save time in short distance route. There are always a large number of vehicles on the roads, especially during the rush hours in the big cities such as New York and Beijing. Instead of driving cars, riding bikes significantly reduce the traffic congestion and help residents save a lot of time in commuting.
It is also reasonable as why cars are popular in some cities. It is widely known that driving is more efficient, particularly in long distance journey. Nowadays, more and more people would like to broaden views and explore new things by tourism. Comparing with the bikes, cars which do not require a lot of energy from travellers and are much faster can save a lot of time and give explorers more opportunities to views more places and scenery. 
In conclusion, in my mind, both approaches have their own pros and cons. There is no good or bad choice, It all depends on personal preference. Cycling can not only curb the carbon emissions but also help people in keeping both physical and mental health. Meanwhile, cars, in developing countries, can give people higher social status and provide a more efficient way for people to achieve the destination.",7.0,6.0,6.0
"The museums play a vital role in saving valuable artefacts and directly reflect the history of a certain country or a nation by exhibiting stuff, that belongs to the past. However, some people find museums boring and not interesting places at all, therefore, they think that exhibitions ought to be more fun. While others convince that museum is the only place for education. This essay argues with the second thought and will discuss both views.

Firstly, redeveloping the historical places to the entertainment facilities will affect the number of interested in learning history. In other words, the subject called history and all things that are connected to this - makes people bored. However, the correct approach to teaching might change the old attitudes. For instance, if our government and teachers were to review the method of educating history, it would positively affect the students' treatment. Making the process of education more enjoyable is a good way to both spend leisure time and learn new about history.

On the other hand, the main purpose of  history is to look at past experiences and learn a lesson along with trying not to make the same wrong decisions in the present, thus, converting museums into entertainment places will devaluate them. Initially, historical places are made for sharing and saving important information, not for having  fun. To illustrate, if  society perceives those places with  joy, the value of the past will significantly decline. In my opinion, it should be taken seriously, accordingly, the primary aim of museums is to educate.

In conclusion, this essay has discussed both views, such as changing  attitudes by introducing the joy and the initial purposes of the historical places. From my point of view, museums ought to remain the same, besides, their aim must be to educate, not have fun.",8.0,6.5,6.5
"Nowadays, the public is very excited to know their past and history. It is certainly true that more numbers of persons in some nations are very keen to know about the historical value of the place where they live and grow up. There are many causes of it. I have given my justification below.

One of the reasons could be due to maintaining the value of their custom, culture and rituals. In other words, they want to sustain the image of their ancestors in society. Secondly, they need to keep the high integrity, and moral values of the place to show a glimpse to the current generation. As a result, this might help our youngsters to know how this house or building is valuable for them and what is the history behind it. Thirdly, it represents the memory, blessings, goodwills and wishes of elderly people who passed their most of their time in the same house. 

Nevertheless, people can research  history in various ways. First of all, they can explore  past records, and updates and meet the other elderly people who live nearby them. Apart from this, they can access the relevant information through newspapers, community centres or government offices. Furthermore, someone can also visit the nearby municipal corporation department to know the details of the buildings. As per research conducted by a few universities in the world, more than 60% of people are exploring the details of their own houses by contacting the authorities.

To conclude,  it is a general trend currently going on to get  information about the home or place where they live. I agree that these activities will subsequently increase and more and more people will follow the path in order to know their past heritage and relation to the present time.",7.0,6.5,6.5
"These days, schools shouldn't taught the students about any skills they only should taught them the academic success and passing examination. So, some people agree with that idea. while, others disagree with that. In this essay i will discuss both sides and i will draw my personal conclusion.

On the one hand, if i agree with that i have some reasons. First of all, the family and friends should do that to make a strong relationship because they will spend over times together. Moreover, they will feel comfortable when they do the skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork because they will do that in some place they love it instead of school. Although, they will be exciting to finish that because they work with people they love them besides, they will have a lot of momert to remember in future.

On the other hand, also if i disagree with that idea i have a lot of reasons. First, definitely school should focus on academic success and passing examinations but also they should make class for student to learn some skills, if they do that the student will love go to school. In addition, the teachers will have more experience about skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork than family and friends and that will help the students to learn faster. However, the students spend may be 6-7 hoursin per day in school and that making them feel boring but if they practice some skills they will feel great and don't prefer about time they spend it there.

In conclusion, after analysis both view, I believe that the both of family and school should taught the student the different skills. Moreover, i agree with tgat because the students spend half the day in school also in home and that helping them to practice very well the skills. Although, i think also the government should make class for the teachers and parents how they teach the students about cookery or dreemaking and woodworks. Also, that great for economy will be higher because all people will join there.",4.5,5.0,5.0

To regard with one school thought that.Firstly,it is true that audio is broadcasted many things which are, some reliable and some are unnecessary as well as it has negative and positive outcomes.So, therefore, youth always does limitation of actions which are telecasted on television, even these scenes are related to hand washing steps, good diet although its about dangerous stunt, luxurious life and so on. As a result, through this practice, children can make their future better or ruin.
Moving further with another segment believes that the past plays crucial role in everyone's life so people should use it wisely.Thus, if teenager spent a lot of points in front of the station, they may become irritable and disturbed.Which act as a rude or misbehaviour with their elder ones.As a ramification, they cannot make a strong relationship with their family members. Moreover, they can distract from study due to spending too much moment while watching video instead of pay attention to the study. As a consequence, they cannot obtain high grades in final exams which put negative impacts in order to cannot find good jobs.
In conclusion, I restate that station gives many more valuable things with few unessential actions. Therefore, parents should keep eyes on their children's activities by this they may adopt very good habits.",6.0,5.0,5.0
"In recent years rather than being well-informed about the details of newly launched products, people are bombarded with all kinds of advertisements. I believe the excessive popularity of advertisements has profound influences on customers and there are some measures which can protect them.

The increasing prevalence of advertising exerts several detrimental effects on consumers. First, commercials might stimulate people to purchase products that they do not really need. In order to approach prospective customers and create brand awareness, many enterprises tend to exaggerate the quality of their products. As a result, unwary consumers who are swayed by glamorous advertisements are easily tempted to impulsively buy goods that are of little use to them. Second, the rising popularity of advertising can also encourage people to form bad habits. For example, as youngsters are not mature enough to distinguish right from wrong or judge what is suitable within society, they might become addicted to playing video games if they are exposed to commercials promoting those products on a frequent basis.

There are several approaches that should be taken into consideration to protect consumers from the adverse effects of advertising. Governments should impose strict regulation on the advertising industry. Under stringent control, most businesses would be more responsible and truthful in promoting their products whether through online advertisements or commercial advertising on prime-time television. This would enable consumers to choose the most suitable and reliable products with greater trust and confidence. Additionally, consumers should have a thorough plan of what they are going to buy before they shop. By doing this, people will have time to prepare and make a wise decision about what products should be bought, which eventually save a great deal of money spent on unnecessary advertised goods.

In conclusion, although the excessive prevalence of advertising brings a lot of di",7.5,7.5,7.5
"In the midst of this technology-driven global world, multimedia is widespread among the present generation, both adults and children. While films and video games are informative and mind-relaxing to some, many convey violence-containing content, that needs to be unpublished in the opinion of a part of the public. This essay will discuss both these views and I will give my opinion by the end.

First and foremost, in this busy society, people find hardly any time to spend in front of the tv and computers. They are more or less mind refreshing after a long stressful work. For example, many people like to listen to music,  watch favourite movies or play games to soothe their mind and relax their body. These stress relievers help to balance a person's overall mental stability.

Secondly, most programmes contain scenes of abuse, and cruelty, without which they might be incomplete. In the present, the crime rates are more when compared to the past. This can be co-related with the influence of inappropriate programme content that adults or children look into. For example, suicide is a common factor seen among  school-going children nowadays. For instance, there are very few who are not educated, hence they can differentiate between good and bad. Even after many scan proofing, these contents may adversely after the upcoming community.

To conclude, in my opinion, media which is more informative with less violent shows should be encouraged for a better future for people of all age groups.",6.5,5.5,5.5
"In this contemporary era, most   people consider luck as a key factor, which enables them to attain better outcomes, whereas others vehemently reckon that hard work , persistent efforts and skill are the main factors behind one's victory. From my perspective, fortune can only guarantee short-term  success and therefore a paramount significance of being industrious, mentally agile can never be overlooked.

To embark with, apparently, Prosperity only comes to those who have indefatigable spirit, talent, determination, mental strength to go through tough times. Many of the examples could be seen on the front cover of Forbes Magazine. An explicit example could be Ratan Tata, Former chairman of TATA GROUP, who had a strong vision to expand his empire internationally and thereby displayed the courage of conviction by taking over British brands like Jaguar and Land Rover, hence achieving his dream of becoming a global leader in the automobile industry. Therefore, it is evident that nothing comes by chance, we need to work meticulously every day to convert our dreams into reality. if the theory that luck is the main precursor behind success true, by now more than ninety per cent of the masses would have been prosperous. But in real life do we see a plethora of people successful? Certainly no.

Besides this, it is pertinent to mention that goddess of fortunes may bless us with only short term achievements and chiefly it is like a gamble. Suppose  a group of students have not studied anything for examination and on the day of the exam, they went to the temple and prayed  for triumph in front of God . Now these prayers might work once but not always. They may be able to clear one exam by chance,

however in further life, they will face a myriad of impediments. So, destiny is a questionable matter and relying on it entirely would be an infeasible approach for future endeavours. Thus luck is simply a minute factor and depending on it will be a short-sighted practice, which",6.5,7.0,7.0
"People have contrasting views about what would be the ultimate goal of an educational institution. While some people opine that school should prepare their pupils as a productive member of society, I think they also should help these children to grow as a person meanwhile.

Firstly, preparing children for employment will ensure their livelihood. If youngsters are provided market-based lectures & environments on their campus, it will create their base for professional life. Consequently, they will be competent by gaining the required knowledge and skills for being recruited by companies or start entrepreneurship. Thus, getting ready for future jobs at an early age helps the children to grasp opportunities in the future and earn their bread and butter. For example, in Bangladesh, the employment rate is 30% higher for the candidates who had graduated from the vocational training centre compared to general.

However, developing children's personality will make them a happy person. An individual may be very successful in life by having a progressive career, yet he may be unhappy and depressed for other internal concerns. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on child cognitive development and improvement of their interpersonal skill so that they could be able to make effective communication, differentiate right and wrong & tackle difficulties. As these young people spend a long time in school, soft skills would be effectively inculcated by them if they are being taught these in the classroom. For instance, punctuality and discipline, two vital qualities a pupil learn from their classroom, which benefits them life-long.

In conclusion, whether making students for future occupations or better characteristics should be the main target of an educational institution is a controversial issue. I think both should be the purpose of a teaching centre for building a complete personality.",9.0,6.5,6.5
"Few people assumes that students can perform better in academics when they are engaged in the competitive sports while many believe that competitive sports are not mandadated in schools. This essay shall highlight the the postive effect of playing the competitive in schools and later discuss the why educational institutions are avoiding the extra curriculum activities in their syallabus.

In the one hand, Sports has been always a great activities for the schoolers to engage in the schools apart from academic course. Moreover, the compitiviness in the games can result positive effect in their education. This is to say that, when students get to play a competitive games in the schools from the early age than they can have the oppotunities to learn the sense of competition from the young age which can help to grow their studies. Furthermore, students participating in the games will boost them to become physically, mentally, and emotionally fit which will eventually assist them to improve thier studies. For instance, according the New York times, 60% of the students who participated in the extra curriculum activities have better academics results than non-participating schoolers. 

On the other hand, plethora of people believes that organizing sports competition in the schools can also bring negative results. This is to say that, playing a competitive game is always full of passion and dedication and every players wants to win. However, in the middle of the heated game, it can lead to a fight and aggressive activities which can have a detrimental effects on the audience.

To sum up, sports activities will have a greater effect in the students for the betterment in their academics course as they can be physically and mentally strong and learn the sense of competiton in their early age.",4.5,5.5,5.5
"Some say that publicity causes positive economic effects, while others would argue that announcements are bad for society since they will make people feel unsatisfied with what they are and what they have. This essay will argue that although advertising captures consumers’ minds, a company’s economy will increase.

On the one hand, all publicity will exaggerate how is the product and try to tell the consumers that their product is the best, and they should have it. This is a way of getting more clients, but sometimes the advertising uses incorrect words and expression to persuade people to buy their products, which harms individuals' heart, and make them doubt  themselves  if they are really  what the announcement says. For instance, there are many announcements that  say that the ones who are watching the advertising are nothing,  they need to consume the company’s product to make the individual happier and have a higher social status. However, I believe that this is easy to solve  since most people know what the companies are trying to do, and they are very self-confident, so are not affected by what others say.

On the other hand, companies will invest in advertisements so they can reach more people. This is because almost everyone will use their mobile phone to watch social media, and if companies insert publicity in these pages, more people are able to know the company and the products they sell. Even though maybe at the time they do not need to buy products,  people will remember the announcement and can search for it in the future. Also, now all social media have a technology that knows what the user likes and what you need, so they will recommend related products. This will cause an increase in the company’s economy. For instance, people using Instagram can watch several advertisements when watching the histories and photos uploaded by their friends, also the application has a dedicated tab for sales. I believe that advertising products allow more indivi",6.5,6.5,6.5
"Nowadays, people are more and more interested in the historical records of places where they live or will going to live in the future because of their curiosity and a lot of other motives that need to know. In this essay, I will examine the reasons why they are doing this and which appropriate ways are the best to find information about their dwelling's history.

    Firstly, people have enthusiasms for wanting to know about their accommodations past owners out of curiosity as the nature of the human. Secondly, most of them investigate about criminal activities or paranormal activities that happened or not in the surrounding areas of their buildings or houses before they buy, in order to get a safe and nice environment. Also, everybody wants to get kind and friendly neighbors so it is also a great idea to do the history check of the apartments or buildings before living in. Lastly, people want to know which historical famous buildings or places might have been built upon their places.

    There are many ways to research about the historical data of buildings and apartments these days. The easiest way is searching or browsing on the internet through various websites. But rather than relying on online information that anyone can post, asking from local elders that lived long enough to know the history of the building will be more accurate and correct. Moreover, building structures, blueprints, and materials that are used to build can be asked from the construction company that built the building.

    In conclusion, people becoming interested in historical records of the places they live in is a great trend by observing from the above reasons. By knowing this, people can avoid the places that are not suitable for them and they can be proud of their places if they found out when those have some great historical values",6.0,6.0,6.0
"Making a profit has long been the top priority of all businesses, yet there has been a growing concern about their corporate social responsibilities. I would argue that companies are obliged to contribute more to society rather than sampling making money. 

On the one hand, I accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in the modern competitive world. It is true that the meaning of the existence of a firm to generate profits for its shareholders and founders maintain operational activities. In fact, production profits after cost deduction, such as rentals, employee payrolls, utilities, taxes would be important to determine company survival. If a company is unable to make profits, it will stop running and go bankrupted, meaning that social obligations become irrelevant. In other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to society if it is in good financial health.

I believe that besides the sole aim of maximizing profit, companies have a wider role to play in modern society. Firstly, in fact, through their manufacturing process, companies could exploit natural resources and discharge toxic sewage without proper treatment, which might lead to irreversible implications for the environment. As a result, firms should invest in their waste treatment systems to mitigate environmental footprint as well as sponsor environmental protection campaigns of the local authorities, which would ensure the suitable expansion of international companies. Furthermore, instead of taking advantage of accounting loopholes, companies should be committed to contributing to society through the tax system, which would foster local prosperity and well-being in the long run.  

In conclusion, I believe that companies should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.",7.5,7.5,7.5
"There are argumentative conceptions heating up a debate over the fact that human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. While some claim that it is too late to do anything, the opposite makes a statement that we should take action immediately to revamp the situation. 

Obviously, there is a large number of reasonable reasons to demonstrate the conception that we are too late in securing flora and fauna sorts of species from people's reckless occupations. In this day and age, along with urban-sprawl and overpopulation is the phenomenon of swarming lands, which gives rise to the ever-growing demand for open areas to live. As a consequence, in recent years, deforestation has taken place horrendously all over the world due to greed for lands and woods to consume. Those destructions on a mass scale cause loss of habitats for plants and animals in wildlife, put them at risk, and more significantly is pushing numerous classifications of species on the brink of extinction. For instance, the clearest evidence is panda species in China, which has been recorded in the Red Book with an alarming threat of extinction, is a victim of severe deforestation. Hence, great quantities of people believe that it is too late to save plant and animal species from humans’ harmful activities.

While the grave sequels of human disadvantageous activities on flora and fauna species are widely acknowledged, the remedies to amend these issues still linger. Notwithstanding the traumatic truth that innumerable forests are terribly damaged, which drags on pushing a great number of plants and animals on the edge of extinction, we can still fix it and we have to take effectual action at this time. Conservation areas ought to be constructed as soon as possible to create sheltered environments for plants and animals, especially species in jeopardy.

"In most countries, teenagers often travel or do a part-time or full-time job for a certain period of time before entering the university. The advantages to this are that they get work experience and proper saving for, paying their tuition fees and it also brings some disadvantages too.
One of a positive side of taking a gap before continuing higher education is getting a valuable work experience by doing part-time or full-time employment. It is true that in many countries a candidate with no experience always struggles to get a good job after finishing tertiary education, whereas, a candidate who has a small experience before entering university often does not struggle to get a job in future. Another positive aspect is saving of some fund. This is because the higher education is so costly that most students do not continue their education, and with such savings not only do they continue their studies, but also do not have to depend on their parents or bank for a loan.
There are many negative sides to this but one of them is losing interest to continue the studies. For example, in China, 65% of students who took a gap of 6 months or a year never came back for their further education due to an interest in earning money. Another downside is that getting involved in bad activities. It has seen in many western countries that few students who travel or work for a certain period seem to get involved in bad influences such as, drugs, shoplifting or robbery.
In conclusion, even though travelling or doing the job for some period gives an opportunity to have work experience and a small saving, downsides to this is showing an interest for earning money rather than continuing study further.",6.5,6.0,6.0
"These days, there are more and more learners are inclined to have focus and attention difficulties during the class-hours. This is mainly because of the lack of interest to the subjects and also digital destruction. There are a number of solution that could be implemented to help them motivated.

Firstly, the foremost reason for the students are not actively involved or participating in the learning process, is due to the material uninteresting. In other words, the learners might find some lessons are boring and irrelevant to their live, which causing the struggle to stay engaged and focused.  Some recent studies reported that most students nowadays seek for practical-subjects in which they could feel, touch, and experience through their activities. Secondly, the use of technology in the classroom is also owing to the increased of distraction. As a result, many schoolchildren may be tempted to use their devices for non-academic purposes such as games, social media, and others.

There are two effective solutions to the problem of lack engagement students in learning. One way to tackle this is by having varied teaching methods that related to the real-word applications. For instance, rather than learning to memorize technical terms or definition, students can explore more or doing experimental studies in the laboratory or school garden. Another method to dealing with students’ interest is by immersing them with something they eager for, computer and hand phone, which attract them more, can be a source of learning flat form during the lesson, but still with a clear policy.

In conclusion, it obvious that by providing practical lessons with enjoyable learning activities and adjusting technology as well are seem to give a solution to this notions. If the stakeholders could implement this, learners will be more pleasant to learn in the future.",4.0,6.0,6.0
"In this sedentary life, physical health has become a serious concern for society. Some people opine that government should take some preventive measures to help the masses whereas, others believe that it should be dealt with by an individual. This essay will discuss both perspectives and conclude with my opinion.

To commence with, people nowadays, tend to eat junk food which is one of the primary reasons for various health diseases like obesity, heart disease, and cancer. On that note, with the help of campaigns, the government must educate the masses about the harmful effects of eating excess junk food and drinks. For example, some countries like Germany and London banned the use of cigarettes. Also, these countries advertise the harmful effects of consuming tobacco in order to improve the health of individuals. Furthermore, the government can imply a heavy tax rate on purchasing such items that can cause major health problems in order to limit the consumption rate.

On the other hand, the masses must be accountable to maintain their good health as it should be an individual responsibility to be fit, and healthy. To elaborate more, as we all know that excess of anything is bad therefore, one should maintain a balanced diet, and limit the consumption of such food items that can be injurious to their health. For instance, recent research has shown that 80 per cent of people enrolled themselves with nutritionists to maintain proper health and diet as a result, there is a decline in  health-related problems.

To conclude, I firmly believe that both the government  and individuals can contribute to encouraging the nation to maintain a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.",8.0,7.0,7.0
"Numerous characters deem our conventional educating program will be altered, and students will not be attending in their classroom; in contrast, certain groups of people oppose and affirm pupils will be studying at school. Besides this, the old educational program will be lasting as usual. I reckon the current model will surely change by the 2050s.

Firstly, from my perspective, I view the revolution has already started. Thanks to cutting edge of technology, now we have more options to continue the lesson and business. For example, all institutes, universities, and companies stopped working because of coronavirus, rendering people to live under quarantine, but still,my university's teachers have been lecturing their lessons using the internet and social channels including Facebook, Google Meet, and Zoom. Hence, this trend will definitely influence the traditional tutor and students interaction.

Secondly, this brand new teaching approach is more sustainable and effortless than any method had existed before. As arriving at college and coming back home takes a lot of time, and we usually do not attend class when we ill. However, we can take a course from an academy by using a mobile phone or computer today, which is simple and has no obstacle. For instance, since I began acquiring knowledge from the internet curriculum, I realized that it took fewer hours than taking a tutorial from a class. Thus, I prefer this new trend  and presume its enhancement is inevitable.

"When there are good quality education nations dominantly flourish ethically as well as  technologically which help to boost state wealth and create an ideal society. It is thought by many individuals that the basic aim of the institution is to make youngsters fine residents and professionals instead of giving them an advantage personally. I would argue in the favor of the mentioned statement and will further explain the reasons behind this.

There are many reasons to support this notion. To begin with, For teens the first learning place as a learner are academies. Since children are being started edification at a very early age, which is the finest period for them to pick the positive and negative aspects of the surrounding easily. Furthermore, They will always go with the same thoughts throughout  life as this era is the best for their mental grooming. To illustrate, According to my country local survey, 80% of the people who are keener to follow laws are universities graduates.

Secondly, The other reason for concurring with this statement is, As institutes are using modern pedagogy along with brand new techno appliances for practical work. Moreover, these teaching methods allow them to learn new developments in science and using this modern equipment make them more skilful and well rounded. Additionally, such people could go easier in their professional careers later on. To cite an example, the National University of science and technology, Pakistan is using modern lab experiments during academic tenure,devoting 70% of the workforce to the multinational companies functioning inside the country compare to other state institutions.

To sum up, I completely agree with this statement that the main purpose of educational institutes is to make  teenagers good dwellers and prepare excellent personal. This is due to schools being the early place for children to be interacted with and these tuition centres are using modern teaching ways to create a workforce. Given ",9.0,6.0,6.0
"It is hard to deny that the internet is still a new-born technology compared to paper and books which have existed for hundreds of years. Such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that keeping knowledge on the internet has many drawbacks. However, as far as economy, environment and educational standards are concerned, I strongly hold that we benefit more from information that is put on the internet. 

First and foremost, storing knowledge on the internet could increase public educational standards as information can be spread more easily over the internet. To be more specific, you can store as much as information you want on the internet and all of it can be checked on any electronic device as long as it is accessible to the internet, there is no constraint on location or time. While the more knowledge is contained in a book, the thicker and heavier it will be. And people can only access the knowledge in that book if they buy or borrow it. Thus, it would be much more convenient to share and spread knowledge through the internet as people are more willing to store and access information on the internet.  

Furthermore, the fact that keeping information on the internet does not require the use of paper indicates that it is very eco-friendly. Take the case of my friend as an example, who shifted the way of studying last year. Starting from then, he made all his notes on a laptop and read electronic books instead of real books. As a result, his personal consumption of paper has declined by over 95%. Therefore, storing knowledge on the internet enables people to reduce their usage of paper, which could save large amounts of water in paper production as well as prevent deforestation to some extent. 

However, a voice arises that storing information on the internet prevents poor people from accessing knowledge as they might find it hard to afford electronic devices. This viewpoint ignores the reality that smart phones have already become a neces",5.0,7.0,7.0

"Knowing about the history of the home that they reside in has become increasingly common among many people in some places around the world. This essay will suggest that this is due to the curious nature of the human kind and further states that people can become more aware about the past by simply surfing the web, followed by a reasoned conclusion.

The main reason for the raising interest in finding out more about their living place is because of  the deeply rooted curiosity. Men, who are well known for their information seeking behaviour  are set on a mission to find out more about their past, ancestory , rich heritage , culture and so on. For Instance, according to an article by the Indian Express, 7% of Indians are more indulged in finding out about their living place than before.

Many can research and learn important facts about their building by the touch of a botton. In other words, the internet serves as a powerful tool in providing such data since the technology has been developed enough to incorporate valuabe information from the past and the present. For example, the landsape of the place before the condo was built, the families who have resided there and any other incidends in particular can be looked up online.

"In today`s contemporary world, we are living in the capitalist time, where one of the most popular issues is the environment. The topic will be elaborated and a particular opinion will be provided. 

 

 

Undoubtedly, environmental damage is supposed to be a crucial today`s problem, because a lot of pollution can be seen in most countries. For instance, air pollution, water pollution, soil erosion and the like, all those features are harmful for our environment. Nevertheless, there are solutions for this problem. I reckon that governments should take responsibility and officials should cancel permit for factories which pollute the environmental. For instance, The Netherlands' government has issued a new regulation saying that factories which damage our environment should be closed and factories producing toxic gas was closed. Nowadays, Holland is by far the cleanest country in the Europe. 

 

On the other hand, environmental pollution is not one problem. Deforestation  is supposed to be one of the major problems in most countries. Deforestation wipes out local animals, such as owls, rabbits and volves. The government should fix it, because deforestation has a harmful impact not only on our environment but on our health. If the government adds some regulation about deforestation, we will save animals living in the forests. Hence, we will less damage local environment. For example, Germany used to have deforestation, Nonetheless, the government of Germany managed to fix it.    was able to fix this issue/problem
To sum up, I strongly believe that a lot of countries have a big problem with the environment and I wish the government would fix it, as soon as possible, like the above countries have done.",5.0,5.5,5.5
"Pay disparity is a growing concern in many large organizations all over the world. While some people support the idea that top-tier officials should earn higher salaries than other employees, others are against this notion. Both views will be discussed in this essay, though I personally feel that the directors of these companies should be paid higher salaries.

Many people think it is unjustifiable to pay managers a wage that is 10 times more than an employee earning the lowest salary in the company. The reason behind this thought is the member's mindset. They believe that the salary paid should be based on the employee's contribution to the growth of the company and not the position of the worker. They argue that a regular employee works much harder and even does extra hours and hence contributes more than the higher authorities towards the success of the organization. This discretion in salary creates low work loyalty and poor motivation among the staff.

However, these people do not understand that salary is not directly proportional to the amount of work done. The remuneration of the higher authorities is based on competition. The board members set a standard salary for executives on the basis of the carcity of competent managers. Moreover, the manager has a lot of responsibilities. Even though he is a manager, he still has to manage his team, manage different projects, make and submit reports to the higher-ups, etc. Therefore, is it justifiable to pay high compensation to the directors of such organizations.

In conclusion, every employee in a company feels that everyone should be equally paid. But in my opinion, the managers should be paid higher than the others for the proper functioning of the institution.",8.0,6.5,6.5
"Our mother Earth is currently facing a lot of environmental concerns. Some people believe that by increasing the fee of fuel we would be able to resolve these issues. In my opinion, it may help to some extant, however,this is not the only solution to clear up this problem.To begin with, people from driving their cars release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which is detrimental to the environment.That is, increasing the price of has can help make people run their own vehicles less often and this change forms the air much cleaner.However, this turn will not stop environmental concerns. Moreover, hiking the price of the fuel will affect weak and middle class family.Yet, another compelling reason against the statement is that, people can handle and lessen environmental problems by some better quick fixes. A good illustration of this is, using renewable sources instead of non-renewable resources would be an appropriate way. For example, solar power is an efficient substitute for gasoline.Furthermore, improving public transportation and encourage people to use them is another practical solution.To put it differently, the capture attraction of people to travel by bus or train.For instance, encourage people to adopt public transportation by decreasing the cost of tickets.Not only will it eliminate air pollution, but it also helps to reduce traffic jam.To conclude, considering the points discussed above, the most rational conclusion to be drawn is that, the hike in the petrol price is not the best solution to this problem. Investing in renewable energy sources and improving the efficiency of public transport is a better alternative that ought to be considered.",6.0,6.0,6.0
"Opinions differ on whether or not children’s cooperative spirit is best fostered via team sports at school. Although such a goal can be achieved through team sports in educational institutions, I believe that there are better solutions for children to acquire that quality.

Admittedly, team sports are competitive by nature; therefore, players can enhance their communication skills, which is one of the qualities that many people need in their adult lives. Football players, for example, usually raise their teammates’ spirit when losing by using motivational language so that they can actively continue to participate in the match. In addition, a sense of responsibility can also be nurtured in team-involved sports, which means that players have to be responsible for their own roles within a team. A good example is Nguyen Quang Hai, who is one of the Vietnamese football players, he apologized to his fans and teammates for having not listened to others and had a poor performance as a result last year. 

However, the student’s involvement in team-playing sports is not the best way for them to improve their cooperation skills, as the time to take part in such activities is usually limited, and there are better long-term options at school, especially examinations and projects. Regarding the former, learners can be taught how to listen to their peers. For instance, the teacher can conduct a debate, which requires students to pay attention to their classmates’ opinions before raising their arguments. With regard to the latter, children are encouraged to develop their time management skills when participating in this form of group work, as they need to cooperate with their group mates to complete their projects before the deadline.  

	In conclusion, despite the fact that children can learn communication skills and have a sense of responsibility via team sports, I believe that these benefits are unsustainable due to time constraints in sports participation at school. Meanw",8.0,7.5,7.5
"It is becoming universal for residents to acquire the stories behind their constructions since the residences can often be dated back to historical ages. The reasons and potential methods to achieve the data collection will be mentioned below.

To commence, it can be pure curiosity that urges people to start searching for stories about where they live.  Constructions from diverse eras varied in shape, style and even material, which made them regarded as one of the most symbolic creations of a peculiar era. The functions of certain designs also became unique features which attracted people's attention. Therefore, I suppose it is a fantastic way to view historical eras through a building. It is also possible to see the specific way of life through the design of the buildings. In addition to acquiring historical knowledge, knowing the stories behind where we live can also strengthen the connection between people and the location. Understanding the stories it has gone through can make people cherish the buildings and create a bond between people and the construction.
